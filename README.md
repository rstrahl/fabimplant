# FabImplant

FabImplant was a venture started in 2015 to create a technology solution that enabled [oral/maxillofacial surgeons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_and_maxillofacial_surgery) to use 3D printing technology to fabricate precision-fit [surgical stents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3056959/) using patients' diagnostic imaging data.

For further details, refer to the [documentation](./docs) directory.

This repository contains the research and development I conducted in pursuit of a proof-of-concept technology solution. It is being made public under the GPLv3 license.
