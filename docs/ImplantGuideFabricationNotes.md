# Mesh Adjustments

- HEIGHT: 2-3mm above the highest point in the neighbouring teeth
- DEPTH: 3mm below the peak of the bone section
- LENGTH: variable length, able to be set by the dentist

- DRILL BIT CHANNEL: 4mm fixed depth (4mm constant from the bone surface)

Misc:
- Ensure that the _undercut_ of the tooth is not filled by the material
- Form the implant guide to the contour of the surface of the mesh (teeth+bone)
